# Building Features

### Understand

- What impact will this have on users?
- What types of behaviour you intend to encourage?
- How will we measure impact?
- What are we willing to give up? What tradeoffs can we make?
- What is driving the deadline?

### Reduce risks

- Can we break it down and release in phases?
- Can we release it to just a small subset of users so we'll be able to see usage before we commit to larger implementation?
- Do we need a scalable solution from Day 1?

### Performance

- Did we collect some statistics regarding the number of events a user will see on average?
- Can we easily measure the addition to the loading time?
- Can we easily turn off the feature?

### Planning

- Aim to increase deadline feasibility.
- The smaller the tasks are, the more accurate our estimations will get.
- How features will be introduced to users?
- Identify dependencies with other teams or organizations upfront.
- Plan. Don't rush into execution.

### Execute

- Create explicit dependencies between tasks.
- Short iterations are the key.
- Constantly communicate internally and externally
- When stuck, be clear on what's blocking.
