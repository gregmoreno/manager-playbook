# Staying Technical

## The why

- You need to ensure decisions pass the technical smell test. Your ability to understand implementation complexity affects how you prioritize and assess risks.
- Your team must see you as technically credible if you truly wish to command the respect of an engineering team.
- You risk making yourself technically obsolete early in your career if you remove yourself of technical responsibilities.

## The challenge

- Your job as manager of a team is to amplify your teammates, not complete coding tasks.
- Maker vs Manager mode of work. In Maker mode, you need uninterrupted continuous hours. In Manager mode, interruptions are part of the job.

## The how

- Block in advance specific hours during the week in your calendar. One trick is to use a different color for the Maker schedule to quickly see your schedule.
- Create signals that you are in Maker mode like setting your Slack status, working in a room,  or putting on your headphones.
- Work on tasks that requires less than 4 hours to complete.
- Stay off the critical path. Your job is to support and mentor; not become a  blocker.
- Boost your team's velocity like exploring new tools to eliminate needless work or reduce technical debt.
- Help in inbound recruiting. For example,  an open-source project that uses your company's API or a demo how your team uses certain technologies.
- Measure and iterate until your find the right balance of maker and manager mode.
