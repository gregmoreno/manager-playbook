# Delegation Plan

## Principles

- Giving your team autonomy is a sign of trust - autonomy is an important element of motivation.
- Aim to put yourself out of job. Make your team capable of operating a high-level without much input from you.
- Priorities work both ways. Intentionally not doing certain tasks is equally important as deciding what to do.

## Guidelines

- Scale yourself by increasing the leadership around you and leveling-up your team with new skills they will need for the next stages of their careers.
- Spend your time and energy on the intersection of what's most important to the organization and what you are uniquely able to do better than anyone else.
- Share what you intend not to do. It shows your team that you made an intentional decision and not because you simply have forgotten.
- Hands off, eyes on. Delegation is not the same thing as abdication. You are still expected to be involved as much as is necessary to help your team succeed.

## Must-Do List

1. Create a spreadsheet with two column titles: Must Do, Delegate.
2. List the responsibilities and tasks you believe you own,  things you do on a regular basis, or even tasks you only did once for your team.  Do not analyze each entry yet. Just do a brain dump.
3. For each task, decide which to own by answering the following questions:
    - Does it utilize my unique strength and responsibilities?
    - Does it serve the leader I want to become?
4. For each task that you do not need to own, add candidates in the Delegate column.
5. Create a delegation plan for every item you intend to delegate.

## Delegation Plan

- Create a document that contains the outcome and behaviors you expect.
- Identify your concerns. Does the person have the skills, experience, and authority to be successful? For each concern (e.g. lacks presentation skills), include how they can be addressed (e.g. setup weekly review and practice).
- Define checkpoints like how often progress is reported, or have interim milestones.
- Include boundary conditions or constraints for the task, e.g. how long the candidate will own the task.

## Retrospectives

- Review your must-do list and delegation plans every month.
- Create a list of tasks where you re-invested your time and review if they can be delegated.
- Collect feedback from your team around their new autonomy and responsibilities.
