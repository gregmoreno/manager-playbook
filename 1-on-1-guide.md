# 1-on-1 Guide

## Why do it

- “A one-on-one is invaluable, sacred time to uncover the truth of how an employee is actually feeling. Everything else comes second.” - Claire Lew
- “90 minutes of your time can enhance the quality of your subordinate’s work for 2 weeks, or for some 80+ hours.” - Andy Grove

## How to prepare

- Review the company's goals, team's goals, your goals, and their goals.
- Review status updates ahead of time. You can use this to orient what to talk about.
- Write all things down. Share with your direct report and let them help draft the agenda.
- Pick 1-3 areas of focus to cover.

## When to do it

- Start with weekly then adjust accordingly. Frequency depends on the following factors:
    - How new is this person to the company?
    - How new is this person to this role?
    - How new is this person to the tasks they need to carry out?
- Duration: 30 minutes - 1 hour
- Block 15 minutes after for review and additional notes.

## How to do it

- Ask your direct report to create and/or review the agenda. Prioritize what your direct report wants to talk about.
- Set aside the first 5-10 minutes of the meeting for personal connection, topics not necessarily related to work.
- Revisit action items from the previous 1-on-1.
