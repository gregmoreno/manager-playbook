# Manager README

## Hi, I'm Greg

What is this weird document? I wrote this for two reasons.

- I want to share my expectations and in doing so, I hope to reduce your anxiety.
- I want to figure out the most effective way of working together by helping you understand me better.

I don't expect this to be a replacement for actually getting to know each other, and neither should you. This is just a starting point. We still need to communicate well and often.

**Disclaimers:**

- This document applies only to me and in no way should be considered applicable to other people at my current company.
- This document will forever be a work-in-progress. Reviewing and updating this document helped me clarify and refine my values.

## How can I help you

- I will clear the way for you so you can figure out what you need to do; how you think it should be done; and then get it done.
- You are very good at your job and I'm not. If I am telling you how to do your job, please let me know as soon as possible.
- I will provide context so you can be successful, connect the dots between what the company needs and help you clarify where to focus your energy.  If you feel you are missing it, let me know and I will fill you in or go get it for you.
- I will help you achieve your career goals. You tell me where you would like to grow and I will do my best to provide you with the opportunities.  You are the driver of your career and I will be there only to help you navigate.
- I will make sure our team is getting what we need from the company and from other teams. Also, I will make sure other teams are getting what they need from us.

## How can you  be awesome

- I expect you to bring your best and do amazing work. If there is anything blocking you from accomplishing this, let's figure it out how to unblock it.
- I expect you to know where the company is heading and to ask if you don't. I expect you think and understand what skills are needed to help the business get there. Successful engineers are those who constantly align with the business and shift focus if necessary.
- I encourage you to always think and question how our work can truly improve the lives of our customers. Great engineers actively participate in product development and always looking for opportunities to improve our product.
- I expect you to constantly deliver value to our customers every sprint. If the work is too big, I expect you to break it down into several deliverables. If it is not possible, let's discuss as a team why not.
- I expect you to raise flag if you feel the deadlines are wrong or as soon as you realize you're not going to meet them.
- I expect you to ask the impact of your work and how it is being used by our customers (if you don't already have this information). We can release all the features we want but if it doesn't solve the underlying business problems, we haven't really solved anything.

## On communication

- It's important we communicate well and often. Most problems come from poor or infrequent communication.
- Do not worry about over communicating.
- If you need to talk, let's talk.
- If you need me, simply ask. Don't assume I'm too busy. Blocked? Needs clarification?  I will find a way to talk to you even if we have to do it outside the regular working hours (assuming that is OK with you).
- You can debate and disagree with me.  I believe ideas improve by filtering out our ego and examining it from different angles. I am always interested why you believe what you believe and I will challenge it with the goal of arriving at the best possible solution. I expect you to challenge mine as well.
- If at any point you feel I'm failing to meet any of my responsibilities, I would appreciate it if you let me know as soon as possible and give me a chance to fix it.
- If you feel you are failing in your job, let me know. We'll work together to fix it.
- Do not be afraid to share your mistakes with me. Mistakes shared is an opportunity to learn. If hidden, it becomes a failure.
- If you see things that do not make sense, call it. Be kind and constructive but never hold back.
- If you are feeling burnout, tell the team. If you are are feeling it but you think you are still good, still tell the team. We will help you get through it.
- One of my jobs is to push. You need to tell me if I'm pushing you and the team over the cliff.
- Our company may require me not tell you about something but they cannot require me to lie to you.
- We will have a 1:1 every week. More on this later.

## On work hours

- I work a bit on nights and weekends, especially Sunday evening as I prepare for the week ahead.  This is my personal choice and I do not expect you to do the same.
- If you got a Slack message from me outside our working hours, I do not expect you to answer.  But I do expect you to close the loop when your work begins on Monday or the next working day.
- The only exception is if it is urgent. My hierarchy (most → least urgent): Call → Text → Slack → Email. If I can't reach you via phone call or text message, I will put a big `URGENT` in my Slack message.

## 1:1s

- We will have a 1:1 every week for at least 30 minutes. Schedule is flexible and can change to fit our schedule but let's both aim to do it consistently.
- 1:1 meetings are primarily for you, and only secondarily for me.
- We will talk about how you feel about your work, your career development, company and team priorities, and opportunities in our department and in the company.
- We will keep a running agenda for our 1:1. I encourage you to check it throughout the week and write anything you might want to talk about. I would also appreciate it if you spend a few minutes beforehand reviewing our agenda so that we can maximize our time together.
- 1:1s are not for urgent matters.

### Nuances

- I am an internal thinker and this often makes others feel I'm not engaged. I am simply internalizing everything before I speak.
- I'm an introvert. I'm comfortable with meetings but terrible with parties and networking events. In large group, I prefer to listen and stay quiet until I'm asked for my opinion.
- I love celebrating the success of others over mine. I am totally fine with staying away from the limelight.
- I swear sometimes.
